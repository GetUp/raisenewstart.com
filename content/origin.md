heading: About the Origin AGM
copy: >-
  Origin Energy have plans to frack up huge regions of the Northern Territory. In their rush to frack up country, culture and water, Origin failed to get proper consent from Traditional Owners, swanning into communities with flashy slideshows and false promises, and glossing over the risks involved with fracking. Time and time again, people across the NT have said no to fracking - it’s too risky, will irreversibly damage water resources and sacred sites.


  Last year, Traditional Owners made waves in the media by turning up outside the Origin AGM to tell shareholders that they had not given permission for the company to frack their land for gas. 


  This year, we’re going bigger. 


  We’ll be rallying outside Origin’s AGM to send them a clear message that no means no. Everyone is welcome.

    **Not in Sydney?** Why don’t you email Origin and tell them not to frack the
    NT?

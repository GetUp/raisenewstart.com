    remote communities’ health at risk, and contributing to catastrophic climate
    change.

    Traditional Owners should have the final say about what happens to their
    land. That’s why they are leading this fight to protect country, taking a
    stand against oil and their fracking plans, and sharing their vision for a
    cleaner, safer, healthier future for us all.

    wreck water, trash land rights and sacrifice communities for profit. Come to

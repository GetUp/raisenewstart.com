    There are more than 700,000 people currently looking for work, and more than 1.1 million people looking for more paid hours. <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6354.0" target="_blank">Yet according to the latest available data</a>, there are only 240,000 jobs available. Unemployment isn’t a choice, and people who are forced to experience it should be able to live with dignity and respect

      When I come across my peers, people who are in exactly the same situation as me, we don’t feel so alone. And we hear each others stories and the wins we’ve had. And we feel like a family and that we actually do matter to people. And it actually empowers us, so when we are speaking up, other people feel brave enough to add their voices as well.

      We come from different backgrounds, we come from all walks of life. And those that end up falling through the cracks, do need a society that maintains a standard that help them keep their dignity.
